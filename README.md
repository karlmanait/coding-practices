## Coding Practice for data structures and algorithms

This repository consists of simple implementations of data structures and algorithms which would be
useful for Software Certifications where importing a library is prohibited.

To practice, delete the source code and implement it from scratch. If implemented correctly, it
should pass the unit tests.
